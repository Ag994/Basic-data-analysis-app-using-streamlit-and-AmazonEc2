   2. Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory of the project.
   
   
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/Ag994/data-analysis-app-using-streamlit.git
   cd data-analysis-app-using-streamlit
   ```
   
   3. Install the required dependencies.
   

   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
